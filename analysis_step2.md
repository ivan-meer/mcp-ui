# Chat Client Analysis - Step 2: MCP Connector

This report details the current implementation of the `MCPConnector` (found as `McpClient`) and its associated transport layers, comparing them against the features described in `internal-docs/CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`.

## 1. MCPConnector (McpClient.ts)

-   **Location:** `packages/mcp-connector/src/client/McpClient.ts`
-   **Summary of Implementation:**
    -   The `McpClient` class extends `EventEmitter` to provide an event-driven architecture.
    -   **Constructor:** Takes `McpClientConfig` (which includes a `transport` instance and other settings like `autoReconnect`, `heartbeatInterval`, `connectionTimeout`).
    -   **Key Properties:**
        -   `status`: Current connection status (`disconnected`, `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, `error`, `closed`).
        -   `server`: Information about the connected MCP server (name, version, capabilities).
        -   `tools`: List of available tools from the server.
        -   `resources`: List of available resources from the server.
        -   `stats`: Connection statistics (uptime, messages sent/received, errors, etc.).
    -   **Connection Handling:**
        -   `connect()`: Initiates connection via the provided transport. Handles connection timeout, server initialization (fetching server info, tools, resources), and starts a heartbeat if configured. Implements auto-reconnect logic with exponential backoff if `autoReconnect` is true.
        -   `disconnect()`: Disconnects from the server, stops heartbeat and retry attempts, and cancels pending requests.
        -   Manages connection status (`_setStatus`) and emits events for status changes (`statusChange`, `connected`, `disconnected`, `reconnecting`).
    -   **Messaging:**
        -   `send<T>(request: McpRequest): Promise<T>`: Sends a JSON-RPC request to the server. Manages request IDs, timestamps, and pending requests with timeouts. Validates outgoing messages.
        -   `notify(notification: McpNotification): Promise<void>`: Sends a notification message to the server.
        -   `_handleMessage(message: McpMessage)`: Internal handler for all incoming messages. Routes responses to pending requests and notifications to `_handleNotification`.
        -   `_handleNotification(notification: McpNotification)`: Handles server-sent notifications, e.g., `tools/list_changed`, `resources/list_changed`, by re-fetching the respective lists.
    -   **Tool Calls:**
        -   `callTool(name: string, args: Record<string, unknown>, options: CallToolOptions): Promise<unknown>`: Sends a `tools/call` request. Checks if the tool exists locally first.
    -   **Resource Handling:**
        -   `getResource(uri: string, options: GetResourceOptions): Promise<unknown>`: Sends a `resources/read` request.
        -   `listTools(): Promise<McpTool[]>`: Fetches and updates the list of available tools.
        -   `listResources(): Promise<McpResource[]>`: Fetches and updates the list of available resources.
    -   **Error Handling:**
        -   Emits an `error` event for various issues (connection, request timeout, server error, etc.).
        -   `McpClientError` custom error class is used.
        -   Retry logic for reconnections is present.
    -   **Lifecycle:**
        -   `destroy()`: Disconnects, destroys the transport, and removes all listeners.
    -   **Other Features:** Heartbeat mechanism (`_startHeartbeat`, `_stopHeartbeat`) to keep the connection alive and detect silent drops.
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md` (`MCPConnector`):**
    -   **Naming:** The implemented class is `McpClient`, while the plan refers to `MCPConnector`.
    -   **Constructor:** The plan's `MCPConnector` constructor takes `ServerConfig`. The implemented `McpClient` takes `McpClientConfig` which includes a `transport` instance. This is a slight difference in how configuration is passed but achieves a similar goal.
    -   **Methods:**
        -   `connect()`: Matches. Implemented with more detailed status management and initialization.
        -   `disconnect()`: Matches.
        -   `sendMessage(content: string): Promise<MCPResponse>`: The plan suggests a generic `sendMessage` for string content. `McpClient` has a more structured `send<T>(request: McpRequest): Promise<T>` for JSON-RPC requests and `notify(notification: McpNotification)` for notifications. This is more aligned with JSON-RPC and MCP's specific request/notification types.
        -   `callTool(name: string, args: any): Promise<ToolResult>`: Matches. Implemented with options and better error handling.
        -   `onMessage(callback: (message: MCPMessage) => void)`: `McpClient` uses an event emitter pattern (`this.on('message', callback)`), which is a common and flexible way to handle incoming messages, rather than a direct `onMessage` method setter.
    -   The implemented `McpClient` is significantly more feature-rich than the basic interface outlined in the plan, including detailed status management, statistics, explicit tool/resource listing, robust error handling, and auto-reconnection.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   **Deviation:** Name is `McpClient` not `MCPConnector`.
    -   **Deviation:** `sendMessage` is not a single method for arbitrary string content but split into `send` (for requests expecting responses) and `notify` (for fire-and-forget notifications), which is more specific to JSON-RPC.
    -   **Deviation:** Message handling is via `EventEmitter` (`on('message', ...)`) not a direct `onMessage` method.
    -   The plan is a basic skeleton; the implementation adds many necessary features like request tracking, timeouts, detailed error types, server initialization protocols, and heartbeat.

## 2. Transport Layers

### a. WebSocketTransport

-   **Location:** `packages/mcp-connector/src/transports/WebSocketTransport.ts`
-   **Summary of Implementation Status:** Appears to be fully implemented.
-   **Connection Handling:**
    -   Uses the `ws` library for WebSocket connections.
    -   `connect()`: Establishes a WebSocket connection to the URL specified in `WebSocketConfig`. Handles connection timeout.
    -   `disconnect()`: Closes the WebSocket connection.
    -   Manages status (`idle`, `connecting`, `connected`, `disconnected`, `error`, `closed`).
    -   Emits `connected`, `disconnected`, `reconnecting`, `statusChange`, `error` events.
    -   Supports auto-reconnection with exponential backoff and jitter.
    -   Implements a ping/pong heartbeat mechanism to monitor connection health and detect silent drops.
-   **Sending/Receiving Data:**
    -   `send(message: McpMessage)`: Converts the message to a JSON string and sends it over WebSocket. Includes a message queue for buffering messages if the connection is temporarily down and `autoReconnect` is enabled. Checks for `maxMessageSize`.
    -   `_handleMessage(data: WebSocket.Data)`: Handles incoming WebSocket messages, parses them as JSON, and emits a `message` event.
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`:**
    -   The plan lists `WebSocketTransport` for remote servers. This implementation fulfills that role.
    -   The plan does not detail the internal implementation of transports, but the current `WebSocketTransport` is robust, including reconnections, heartbeats, and message queuing, which are essential for a reliable WebSocket client.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   No significant deviations from the high-level plan of having a WebSocket transport.
    -   TODOs mentioned in the file: WebSocket extensions (compression), circuit breaker pattern, Prometheus metrics, subprotocol support.

### b. LocalProcessTransport

-   **Location:** The plan mentions `LocalProcessTransport`. The `index.ts` exports `LocalTransport` from `'./transports/LocalTransport'`. However, the file `packages/mcp-connector/src/transports/LocalTransport.ts` (or `LocalProcessTransport.ts`) **was not found** in the repository. The `ls` command for `packages/mcp-connector/src/transports/` only listed `WebSocketTransport.ts`.
-   **Summary of Implementation Status:** Not implemented (file missing).
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`:**
    -   The plan includes `LocalProcessTransport` for local servers. This component appears to be missing.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   Deviation: The export in `index.ts` is `LocalTransport`, while the plan refers to `LocalProcessTransport`.
    -   Unimplemented: The entire transport layer seems to be missing.

### c. SSETransport (Server-Sent Events)

-   **Location:** The plan mentions `SSETransport`. The `index.ts` exports `SSETransport` from `'./transports/SSETransport'`. However, the file `packages/mcp-connector/src/transports/SSETransport.ts` **was not found** in the repository.
-   **Summary of Implementation Status:** Not implemented (file missing).
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`:**
    -   The plan includes `SSETransport` for HTTP-based servers. This component appears to be missing.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   Unimplemented: The entire transport layer seems to be missing.

## General Observations on MCP-Connector

-   The `McpClient` is well-structured and provides a comprehensive set of features for interacting with MCP servers, going beyond the basic outline in the plan.
-   The `WebSocketTransport` is also well-developed with crucial reliability features.
-   A major gap is the absence of `LocalProcessTransport` and `SSETransport`, despite being listed in the plan and exported (as dangling references) in the package's `index.ts`. This limits the connectivity options of the `McpClient` to WebSocket only.
-   The package uses `EventEmitter` for event handling, which is a standard and effective pattern.
-   Error handling is considered, with custom error types and reconnection strategies.
-   The code includes educational comments and clear structure.
