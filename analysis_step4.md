# Chat Client Analysis - Step 4: UI Renderer

This report details the current implementation status of the `UIComponentRenderer`, comparing it against the features described in `internal-docs/CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`.

## 1. UIComponentRenderer

-   **Location:**
    -   The entry point `packages/ui-renderer/src/index.ts` was **not found**.
    -   A listing of the `packages/ui-renderer/` directory revealed it only contains a `package.json` file. There is no `src/` directory or any source files (like `UIComponentRenderer.tsx`).
-   **Summary of Implementation:**
    -   The `UIComponentRenderer` component is **not implemented**.
    -   The `packages/ui-renderer` package appears to be a placeholder, lacking any functional source code.
    -   Therefore, there is no current implementation for handling HTML resource blocks, iframe sandboxing, or event marshalling from rendered UI components.
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`:**
    -   The plan specifies a `UIComponentRenderer` component with the following props:
        ```typescript
        interface UIComponentRendererProps {
          resource: HtmlResourceBlock;
          onEvent: (event: UIEvent) => void;
          sandbox?: boolean;
          maxHeight?: number;
        }
        ```
    -   The plan indicates it should provide "безопасный рендеринг iframe" (secure iframe rendering).
    -   This functionality is entirely missing.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   The entire `UIComponentRenderer` component and all its planned features (HTML resource handling, iframe rendering, sandboxing, event handling) are unimplemented.
-   **Security Measures:**
    -   Since the component is not implemented, no security measures (iframe sandbox attributes, CSP, etc.) related to rendering external HTML content are currently in place within this package.
    -   The `MessageList.tsx` (in `packages/chat-ui`) does have a placeholder for rendering `message.type === 'ui-component'`, but it currently just shows a placeholder div and includes a "TODO: Здесь будет настоящий UIRenderer".

## General Observations on UI-Renderer

-   The `ui-renderer` package is a critical part of the planned architecture for displaying rich UI components sent by MCP servers. Its absence means that the chat client cannot currently render any interactive UI components beyond simple text messages.
-   The placeholder in `MessageList.tsx` indicates awareness of this component's necessity, but the actual implementation in the `ui-renderer` package has not been developed.
-   This significantly impacts the client's ability to fulfill the "Интерактивного использования инструментов через UI компоненты" (interactive use of tools via UI components) and "Визуализации возможностей серверов через демо компоненты" (visualization of server capabilities via demo components) goals from the project plan.
