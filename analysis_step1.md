# Chat Client Analysis - Step 1

This report details the current implementation of the core chat client components and compares them against the features described in `internal-docs/CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`.

## Core Component Analysis

### 1. ChatWindow

-   **Location:** `packages/chat-ui/src/components/ChatWindow.tsx`
-   **Summary of Implementation:**
    -   The `ChatWindow` component serves as the main container for the chat interface.
    -   It takes `messages`, `onSendMessage`, `onChatEvent`, `config`, `connectionStatus`, `activeServer`, `isTyping`, and `isLoading` as props.
    -   It internally manages `inputValue` and `isInputFocused` states.
    -   It includes logic for auto-scrolling to new messages.
    -   It handles message sending via `handleSendMessage` callback and supports Enter key submission (configurable with `Shift+Enter` for new lines).
    -   It displays a header section showing active server information and connection status.
    -   It renders an empty state if no messages are present.
    -   It maps over the `messages` array to render `MessageBubble` components for each message.
    -   It shows a typing indicator.
    -   It has a `MessageInput`-like area at the bottom with a textarea and a send button. This input area is part of `ChatWindow` itself, not the separate `MessageInput` component from the same package (though it's very similar in functionality).
    -   The `MessageBubble` is an internal component within `ChatWindow.tsx` responsible for rendering individual messages, including user, assistant, system, UI component placeholders, and error messages. It also shows timestamps and server names based on config.
    -   It has basic responsive design considerations (compact mode).
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`:**
    -   The plan defines `ChatWindowProps` with `servers`, `activeServer`, and `onServerSwitch`. The current implementation has `activeServer` but not `servers` or `onServerSwitch` directly. Server management seems to be handled outside this component, with connection status and active server info passed in.
    -   The plan implies `ChatWindow` is a top-level container. The current implementation uses `MessageList` and `MessageInput` from `@mcp-ui/chat-ui` as per `App.tsx`, but `ChatWindow.tsx` itself seems to re-implement message listing (via `MessageBubble`) and message input functionalities rather than directly using the separate `MessageList.tsx` and `MessageInput.tsx` components as children. This is a significant deviation. `App.tsx` passes its own `messages` and `handleSendMessage` to the `ChatWindow` from `@mcp-ui/chat-ui`.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   **Deviation:** Does not seem to directly use the separate `MessageList` and `MessageInput` components from its own package as children; instead, it re-implements similar functionality (`MessageBubble` for rendering messages, and its own textarea input). `App.tsx` *does* import `MessageList` and `MessageInput` from `@mcp-ui/chat-ui` alongside `ChatWindow`, but it seems `ChatWindow` itself doesn't use them. The `ChatWindow` in `App.tsx` is configured with `messages` and `onSendMessage` suggesting it handles these itself.
    -   No direct server switching functionality (`onServerSwitch`) as per the plan's props.
    -   Markdown rendering for messages is a TODO.
    -   Drag & drop for files is a TODO.
    -   Context menu for messages is a TODO.
    -   Virtualization for message list is a TODO within `ChatWindow.tsx` (though `MessageList.tsx` has it).

### 2. MessageList

-   **Location:** `packages/chat-ui/src/components/MessageList.tsx`
-   **Summary of Implementation:**
    -   Designed for displaying a list of messages with performance optimizations.
    -   Props include `messages`, `config`, `onMessageEvent`, `filters`, `estimatedMessageHeight`, `autoScroll`, `isTyping`, `messageRenderer`, `className`.
    -   Implements virtual scrolling using `containerHeight`, `scrollTop`, and `estimatedMessageHeight` to render only visible messages.
    -   Includes memoization (`React.memo`) for performance.
    -   Uses `IntersectionObserver` for lazy loading and auto-scrolling (though `ResizeObserver` is used for container height).
    -   Features message grouping: messages from the same sender within a short time window are grouped.
    -   Supports filtering of messages based on type, serverId, status, date range, and search text.
    -   Has a `DefaultMessageRenderer` internal component to display individual messages if no custom `messageRenderer` is provided. This renderer handles different message types (`user`, `assistant`, `system`, `ui-component`, `error`), shows status, and includes message actions (copy, delete for user messages).
    -   Displays an "EmptyMessageList" component when no messages match filters or if the list is empty.
    -   Shows a typing indicator.
    -   Includes a "Scroll To Bottom" button when the user has scrolled up.
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`:**
    -   The plan defines a `Message` interface with `id`, `type`, `content` (string or `HtmlResourceBlock`), `timestamp`, `serverId`. The `MessageList.tsx` uses a similar `Message` type (from `../types`) which includes these fields plus `status`, `error`, `serverName`, etc.
    -   The plan's `Message` type includes `'ui-component'` type and `HtmlResourceBlock` for content. `MessageList.tsx`'s `DefaultMessageRenderer` has a placeholder for UI components (`message.type === 'ui-component'`) and refers to `message.content.uri`, aligning with the plan for richer content.
    -   The core functionality of displaying a list of messages aligns well with the plan.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   The actual rendering of `HtmlResourceBlock` (UI components) is a TODO within `DefaultMessageRenderer` ("Здесь будет настоящий UIRenderer").
    -   Infinite scroll for message history is a TODO.
    -   Context menu for messages is a TODO (though basic actions like copy/delete exist).

### 3. MessageInput

-   **Location:** `packages/chat-ui/src/components/MessageInput.tsx`
-   **Summary of Implementation:**
    -   An advanced input field component.
    -   Props: `onSendMessage`, `onInputEvent`, `config`, `availableTools`, `isLoading`, `isConnected`, `showHints`, `className`, `placeholder`.
    -   Exposes methods via `ref`: `focus`, `clear`, `insertText`, `getValue`.
    -   Manages state for `value`, `isFocused`, `attachments` (file uploads), `showAutocomplete`, `autocompleteQuery`, `selectedSuggestionIndex`, `charCount`, `isDragOver`.
    -   Features auto-resizing textarea height.
    -   Supports autocompletion for MCP tools (triggered by `/`).
    -   Handles message sending (Enter key or button) and includes the `attachments` in the `onSendMessage` callback.
    -   Supports file attachments via drag & drop and a file input button. Shows previews for images and lists attachments.
    -   Includes character counter.
    -   Provides user hints for submitting messages, tool autocomplete, and drag & drop.
    -   Internal components: `AutocompleteDropdown`, `AttachmentsList`, `AttachmentPreview`, `InputHints`.
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`:**
    -   The plan specifies `MessageInputProps` with `onSend`, `availableTools`, `isLoading`. The implementation has `onSendMessage`, `availableTools`, `isLoading`, and many more configuration options.
    -   Autocompletion of tools is implemented as planned.
    -   The plan doesn't explicitly mention file attachments for `MessageInput`, but it's a feature in the "Phase 4: Integration and improvements > File Handling" section. The component already has robust file attachment capabilities.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   Emoji picker is a TODO.
    -   Slash commands for quick actions (beyond tool autocomplete) are a TODO.
    -   Mention support (`@`) is a TODO.
    -   Link preview is a TODO.
    -   Improved handling for large files with progress bars is a TODO.

### 4. ServerSidebar

-   **Location:** Expected at `apps/chat-client/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (imported as `Sidebar` in `App.tsx`).
-   **Summary of Implementation:**
    -   The source code for this component could not be located in the repository at the expected path (`apps/chat-client/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`) or other common locations, despite being imported and used in `apps/chat-client/src/App.tsx`.
    -   `App.tsx` passes `isOpen`, `onClose`, `servers`, `activeServer`, `onConnectServer`, `onDisconnectServer` as props to it.
-   **Comparison with `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md`:**
    -   The plan defines `ServerSidebarProps` with `servers`, `onAddServer`, `onRemoveServer`, `onServerSelect`.
    -   Based on props in `App.tsx`, it manages server connections (`onConnectServer`, `onDisconnectServer`) and lists servers. This aligns broadly with the plan's intent.
-   **Deviations/Unimplemented Features:**
    -   Cannot be fully assessed as the source code is missing or not found.
    -   It's unclear if it implements `onAddServer` or `onRemoveServer` directly as the props in `App.tsx` don't show these being passed in. These functionalities might be handled elsewhere or are yet to be implemented.

## Other Noted Files from `App.tsx` imports

The following components are also imported in `App.tsx` via ` '@/components/...'` but their source files could not be located:

-   `LoadingSpinner` (from ` '@/components/LoadingSpinner'`)
-   `Header` (from ` '@/components/Header'`)
-   `StatusBar` (from ` '@/components/StatusBar'`)

This suggests these files might also be missing from the repository or there's an unresolved issue with file discovery for the `apps/chat-client/src/components/` directory.

## General Observations

-   The project uses a monorepo structure with `packages` (like `chat-ui`) and `apps` (like `chat-client`).
-   Styling is done with Tailwind CSS.
-   State management seems to involve Zustand (`useMcpStore`, `useChatStore` in `App.tsx`).
-   The `CHAT_CLIENT_PLAN.md` is detailed and provides a good roadmap.
-   There's a slight inconsistency: `ChatWindow.tsx` in `packages/chat-ui` seems to have its own message rendering and input logic, while `App.tsx` imports `MessageList` and `MessageInput` separately from `@mcp-ui/chat-ui` to be used alongside or within `ChatWindow`. However, `ChatWindow` itself is passed `messages` and `onSendMessage` directly in `App.tsx`, suggesting it handles these aspects. The plan's `ChatWindow` didn't explicitly state it would *contain* `MessageList` and `MessageInput` as distinct child components, but it's a common pattern.
-   The `Message.tsx` component from the initial request was found to be an internal component named `DefaultMessageRenderer` within `MessageList.tsx`.
-   A significant number of UI components expected in `apps/chat-client/src/components/` (Sidebar, Header, StatusBar, LoadingSpinner) could not be located by the `ls` tool. This is a critical issue for understanding the full picture of `chat-client` app.
